  I attend an after school program known as, Code Nation. During the 2nd unit, we beginner programmers were assigned a project. And in this project, 
we were told to create a semi-text adventure game. I decided to make a semi-text adventure game where your goal is to escape with the stolen as a mouse. 
I thought that a Pokemon type battle would be a nice addition to this game so I decided to add it to the final stage of the game. 

All the art was made by me using an online pixel art editor which can also be used to make sprite sheets. https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite
